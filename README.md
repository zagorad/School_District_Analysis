# School_District_Analysis
In the analysis above, we took students level standardized test scores in reading and math for all the high schools in the city school district and analyzed the data to provide information about patterns and trends. From the analysis we can conclude that per student budged between public and charter high schools, there was a small difference, which means any testing difference is not due to district funding. When comparing the reading and math average scores, as shown in the tables above, the reading scores were nearly identical. The big difference in the average scores between charter and public schools was the math scores, the average for charter schools was 4 points more than public schools.
